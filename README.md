Aim : To develop a Graphical user interface for generating artifically augmented data used for
training deep learning models.
Users : b-it bots @work lab - HBRS
Requirements :
1) Build a pipeline to artificial generate annotated data for training deep learning models.
2) Pipeline includes starting from capturing images using provided camera (Realsense),
generate semantic labels of the captured image and then generate the artificial images.
3) GUI required for the end user from capturing to labelling and generating new data.
4) Making the software pip/conda installable
5) Writing test cases
6) Integration with github CI
Delivarables :
1) At the end of SDP course, expected to deliver working software as per the above mentioned
requirements.
